# DE have removed the ability to retrieve bounty stages. Therefore this no longer works.


# BountyChecker
A tool to check Cetus Bounties in Real Time

# How does this work?
It reads and parses your EE.log

# Will I get banned for this?
Short Answer is: no.
Long Answer is: The Scripts parse EE.log, the logfile where Warframe logs all sorts of stuff, also bounty stages. A lot of 3rd parts Apps (such as YATE, Alecaframe and PTAnalyzer) use this to work. So far I am not aware of anyone being banned, but use at your own risk as any other program. 

# It shows up as a Virus?!?
Unfortunately, this is how it currently is. The source code is freely avaible here though and you can choose to check it and modify it as you please.

# How to get the .py working?
Install Python 3.12 (this is what is has been tested on, may work on lower versions too). Then do `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder.

# Will this get updates?
Yes

# MacOS?
If you, for whatever godsaken reason play Warframe on MacOS, [RaajYedida made a port of this for MacOS](https://github.com/RaajYedida/WFBountyCheckerMacOS)
